## Use a new interface to work with Arbor apps

This tutorial will help you use a new Arbor interface.

## Step 1

First go here and create a user account: (see register in the top right corner)

[http://54.82.147.249:8080]http://54.82.147.249:8080

## Step 2

Email Curt (curtislisle@gmail.com) that you have a login, so that he can add you to a user group that can run tasks.

## Step 3

Navigate to this address (same root with /arbor_apps at the end).  
http://54.82.147.249:8080/arbor_apps/[http://54.82.147.249:8080/arbor_apps/]

## Step 4

The way to try the interface is to load a tree & matrix, then pick a function to run.   To load the tree and matrix, click the tabs at the bottom of the blue bar (e.g. PHYLOGENETIC TREE).  This moves to the “current tree” panel, which will initially be empty.  Next, click on the title “Phylogenetic ‘Tree (.phy)” below (with the white background).  This should open a dialog that lets you browse any collections on this instance for data.  There is an “example data” collection with trees and matrices in it.   

## Step 5

Repeat this process to load a character matrix.

## Step 6

Other tabs should appear on the blue bar for each easy-mode function loaded.  Select one of these and click the column from the matrix you want to use to perform the operation.  

## Step 7

You should see a green “progress circle” with status next to it, like Queued, Running, Pushing Output, and then the output of the method should display.
