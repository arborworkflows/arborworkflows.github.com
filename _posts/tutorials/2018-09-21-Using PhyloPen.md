## Evaluating PhyloPen

Please try the following exercise to evaluate the current version of our new application PhyloPen. PhyloPen is an interface that lets you interact with a phylogenetic tree and a matching trait matrix to explore features about organisms and their relationships to each other.

If you have any difficulties during the exercises, please feel free to ask for assistance. Also, remember
to consult the tables that show what gestures can be performed in PhyloPen (i.e., pen and multitouch gestures.)

Before starting, please complete this pre-activity <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sKxdYsaRTeQTpsUTFE3H77uYpZe08xOjyj_n_YEAOhc/edit?ts=5ba2af03" target="_blank">survey</a>.

The instructions for PhyloPen are [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PhyloPen/exercise.instructions.phylopen.Sept2018.pdf). Download and save this file somewhere to your computer. Follow these instructions to test the various capabilities of PhyloPen using the supplied tablet.

Next, attempt to complete the same tasks in Mesquite using these [instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PhyloPen/exercise.instructions.mesquite.Sept.2018.pdf).

When you have completed the exercises, please provide feedback using this post-actvity <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Xe3d0uOOalzmPhpkF-BRYR5YOTCkqQ0L9_Co-bjDGLY/edit?ts=5ba30ebb" target="_blank">survey</a>
