# Guide to Arbor naming, style, and formatting

Arbor is open-source and open to collaborations. As such, there are no hard and fast rules about style. At the same time, coherent style can help code bases grow.

## Code style

For simplicity, we recommend following as closely as possible the Google style guides for [R](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and [python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

Include comments in your code to help people understand what is happening.

When functions and workflows are added to Arbor, text descriptions of the function as well as all input and output variables should be included.

## Naming conventions

Functions and workflow names should be in CamelCase.

## Documentation

Follow our guides to documenting [functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/styleGuide/functions/), [workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}/styleGuide/workflows/), and [collections]({{ site.baseurl }}/styleGuide/collections/)

## Testing

Coming soon.

## References

All documentation must include the references that should be cited when a particular function or workflow is run. This includes citations to any R packages that are used by the function/workflow.
